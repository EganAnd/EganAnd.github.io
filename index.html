My technical skills include proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualizations utilizing Python and Tableau.</p>
                <p>In addition to my recent data work, I am an experienced manager with over 20 years of business experience, specializing in strategic business development, market analysis, and vendor management. I have a proven ability in data-driven decision-making and enhancing customer experiences. As the former CEO of Tampa Bay Outfitters, LLC, I successfully grew the business and managed a wide range of operations, including inventory control and staff training. With a strong background in sales and marketing, I have a knack for building long-term business relationships and driving revenue growth. In addition to my professional expertise, I am an avid cyclist and certified USA Cycling Level 3 Coach.</p>
