                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have successfully completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Below are some of the data projects I have worked on in the course as well as on my own. My technical skills include proficiency in exploratory data analysis and machine learning utilizing pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and xgboost Python libraries.  I am also proficient in data visualization using matplotlib, seaborn and Tableau.</p>
                <p>In addition to my recent data work, I am an experienced manager with over 20 years of business experience, specializing in strategic business development, market analysis, and vendor management. I have a proven ability in data-driven decision-making and enhancing customer experiences. As the former CEO of Tampa Bay Outfitters, LLC, I built the business from the ground up, successfully growing revenue and profits. In the process I managed a wide range of operations, including inventory control, strategic planning and staff training. With a strong background in sales and marketing, I have a knack for building long-term business relationships and driving revenue growth.
